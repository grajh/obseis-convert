# obseis-convert
Convenient Python script for converting seismograms between file formats supported by ObsPy. Also supports extracting seismogram parameters from a filename, based on an input template. Works in both Python 2 and 3. An end user only has to define input file folder, input file format, input file extension and output file format. Script reads only those files in the folder with the specified file extension. Seismogram parameters written in filename can be extracted and written in output file. In this case the user has to provide a template in a specified form. Currently the script writes new seismogram files with the same name, but different extension in the same folder as input files.

Dependencies:
- Obspy
